If you come to me with public transport, the stop is just in front of the building complex. Here it has countless shops on site. You can reach the main train station in about 5 minutes and the banks of the Zürissee in less than 10 minutes. It is best to reach access to me through the courtyard. There is often operation here, you can chill, play, grill or just read a book. The former factory building was rebuilt in 2014? 2015 and houses 40 different owners. When you are in the building, you can feel this cosmopolitan flair and the lively activity, just a real city object. There are many uses for my almost 90 m2 area. I am suitable as a modern residential object. You can also use me well as an office. The high level of expansion and a room height of 3.00 m looks impressive and provides an impressive living experience. You have many ways to use me and furnish me. The floor plan is ideal. What is certainly noticeable immediately is my spacious cuisine, equipped with everything it needs? Microwave, steamer, grill, hob, oven, heat drawer, food center with ice machine, washing machine and lots of storage room; A dream for everyone who likes to cook. How you use the rest of the living space is entirely up to your imagination. The whole thing is very bright and flooded with light through the window front. The wet cell is generous, has a bathtub, a large lavabo and a toilet. I would also like to emphasize that I can already be fully furnished.

Kramgasse ,"Hey if you (or you as a couple) want to live for four (or five) on 3.5 floors in a beautiful 9.5-room triplex apartment on 400qm then you are right with us! Our modern apartment is located in the middle of the old town of Bern and has all sorts of jewels that your friends will envy you :) You share a sunny roof terrace with us (which can really be seen!) And enjoy your evening drink with a view of the cathedral tower , the belts and throne over the old town roofs. The apartment was created in 2010, is unique and awarded an architecture price. If you don't feel like sitting on the roof terrace anymore, you may use our cinema room and Netflixt on red, velvety cinema chairs. Or you greet your friends in the aperitif, cook them in a 35sqm kitchen with the best cooking island you have ever seen. A steamer, induction stove and also a wine refrigerator are available. We have washing machine/tumbler in the apartment for the laundry. And while you are waiting for the laundry you can pass the time in the 50sqm living room when listening to music. In short: we have so much space that it does not even become close to the fifth of the five (not even in Corona crisis times). And otherwise there would also be the guest room in which you can withdraw and that we also use as a home office from time to time. Of course, we are also incredibly great, open -hearted, nice, funny, exciting and warm roommates who will share this madness with you. We are looking for you, young, sociable, open and neat. The move -in date is possible from October 1, 2022. We like to live together, eat together from time to time, listen to music, grilling, laugh and cry and so on. Of course, everyone also needs retreats (of which we have read, as you read). A cleaning team comes by twice a month to clean the three bathrooms and the kitchen for the rest we have a cleaning plan. We like to have a visit, are busy, share and eat together, are flexible and like to be fine. Part of our palace is a 2.5 room duplex apartment with its own bathroom (including shower and bathtub), living room, bedroom and gallery. This great place will be released in October and is looking for new society. In the rest of the apartment, life distributed Fabienne (32) commutes between Lucerne, Chur and Bern. Our mountain doctor is often on the mountain bike, racing bike or the ski and is bribed with popcorn David (36), our funny Latino from Curacao is active in the financial sector and is often enthusiastic about an aar shock, a barbecue evening or a round of Mary (or recently also futurama) Sam (38), an IT Egg burst and musician. If he does not indulge in his existence as a hobby rock star, he chases tennis or squash balls behind or tries to rush his friends to rush the ping pong table. (Hey !!! I also like completely nonsensical Netflix documentary and YouTube videos, why is that not ???) And with us under the old town roofs you will soon live for two! Are you interested? Then get in touch with us, we will be happy to contact you.
